She specializes in public relations, organizational communication, corporate communication, rhetorical studies and race. With over 20 years working in communication, she is the perfect professor to be teaching here at Virginia Tech.

Next chapter covers public relations building global trust and brand relevance in social media, and finally a rhetorical analysis of landmark corporate speech rights rulings. She has also published several articles over the years as well. </p>

    <h2>Course Description</h2>
<p> This course explores the role of communication in complex organizations (e.g., schools, businesses, governments, healthcare systems, non-profits, churches). It focuses on how communication creates and is created by organizations. This course uses theoretical and pragmatic approaches to explore communication networks and flows, message systems, decision-making, and management. At the end of the course, students will be able to recognize and evaluate the various ways organizational communication influences our daily lives.</p>


    <h2> Interests </h2>
    <p> Dr. Logan has many interests, many of them being in the field of communication. She explained that her favorite communication topics include public relations, rhetorical studies, organizational communication, corporate discourse and diversity. She enjoys teaching, researching, publishing and consulting in the prior areas. She believes that communication is fundamental to the human experience, therefore she has spend much time analyzing and maximizing the value of communication. </p>
    <p> Outside of communication, Dr. Logan enjoys being active. As a young student at University of Georgia she was on the women's gymanstics team there. During her time as a gymnast she had the honor of receiving three All-American honors for her athletic performance. She received these honors in her uneven bars, balance beam and floor routines. </p>

    <h2> My Opinion </h2>
      <p> I really enjoy taking Dr. Logan's organizational communication class. I have learned a lot from it as she focuses it towards real world examples in the workplace, which most of us are entering in the next couple of months. I have enjoyed learning more about leadership styles that work well for me, both to work with and use in my own roles. Dr. Logan is a very understanding professor and will work with you to achieve success. Although the course is online, I feel as if I was able to still build a relationship not only with Dr. Logan, but with the class. She assigned group projects, which at first I thought was crazy wwith it being an online class, but with the technoloigcal advancements these days, there will be continuous online group projects for many careers, and it was important to learn how to work together online. </p>
      <p> I would recommend this class to all communication students as it is very informative, and not a lot of work. The class has entailed 10 online assignments, ranging from discussion boards to short papers, two exams and two group projects. It is nice to have a steady calendar knowing each week everything is due on Sunday's. Overall, I have loved this class and will take a lot of my learnings with me to other classes, as well as to my future career.</p>
