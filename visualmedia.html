    <h2> Professional Biography </h2>
    <p> Dr. Evia has been teaching here at Virginia Tech since 2004 where he started as an assistance professor of Technical Communicatio. After a few years as assistant professor, Dr. Evia became an Associate Professor (with tenure) in 2011. Shortly after, in May of 2012 he became the Director of the Undergraduate Program in Professional and Technical Writing. He also had the role of coordinator of undergraduate student internships from January 2016 to May of 2018. Along with his work in the English department, Dr. Evia spent about three years also working for Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine as the Associate Professor of Interprofessionalism. As you can see he has a diverse background in his education and teachings which qualifies him as an expert in my eyes. </p>
    <p> During him time teaching at Virginia Tech he has taught both undergraduate and graduate classes. The  undergraduate classes include: </p>

    <ul>
       <li><p>Visual Media</p></li>
       <li><p>Writing for the Web/Developing Online Content</p></li>
       <li><p>Issues in Professional and Public Discourse</p></li>
       <li><p>Writing and Digital Media</p></li>
       <li><p>Creating User Documentation</p></li>
       <li><p>Technical Writing</p></li>

    </ul>
    <p>Dr. Evia also has many publications to be proud of. He has written ten journal articles, published two books, written four book chapters, had two industry publications, and many others. He had the opportunity to perform a Keynote Speech in 2012 on technical communication as entertainment education. His communication skills have been put to the test professionally, and his hard work paid off as he has performed over 20 conference presentaitons. At this rate he should be teaching public speaking!</p>

    <h2> Research </h2>
    <p> A lot of the research that Dr. Evia has performed has worked with different cultures, primarily Hispanic and Latino. One of his larger research projects was "Micro-processes of Latino Construction Worker's Health". Dr. Evia being such the caring guy he is, he wanted to improve workplace safety for immigrants. </p>
    <p> Dr. Evia's "baby" is a research project he conducted with Michael Priestley and Keith Schengili-Roberts. The research was on lightweigh DITA SC, in short he worked on a simplified specialization of HTML5 or Markdown to define new topic types. He has taught us a lot in class about basic coding skills using HTML and CSS, and his interest in the topic makes sense in class now based on his extensive research. </P>

    <h2>Course Description</h2>
    <p> What we learn in this class will help us in future classes as well as careers in the communications field. We worked on four different projects, ranging from magazine spread designing with InDesign, photo taking and editting, video filming and editting with Adobe Premiere and basic HTML skills.</P>


    <h2> Interests </h2>
    <p> Dr. Evia is one of the funniest, most upbeat professors I have had. He likes to joke around and have a good time with his students. He has talked a lot about spending time with his daughter Sophia and watching Disney with her and teaching her the basics of visual media. He incorprates her when grading projects from his students to broaden her young knowledge. Dr. Evia also talks about his mother and her funny sayings of english words. His interests are his family and his communication research. </p>

    <h2> My Opinion </h2>
      <p> I have enjoyed every visual media class since the first day of fall semester. Dr. Evia is a thoughtful, educated, passionate and helpful professor who makes coming to class exciting and worth your time. He genuinely cares about the success of his stuents and it shows. He takes the time to explain all the content in a fun and knowledgeable way. Dr. Evia is very understanding of class conflicts and will work with all students to ensure projects are done to the best of the students ability, no matter what. I have really enjoyed learning about different Adobe Creative Cloud programs and visual media techniques through the passion Dr. Evia has portrayed to the class. Everything I have learned in this class will hopefully be beneficial to my future careeer and I am looking forward to continuing to learn more. </p>
