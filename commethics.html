She also has a new kitten named Peanut who loves looking at his reflection in the mirror. Lastly, the beta fish, Dumbledore. Dr. Mackay got her beta fish shipped to her from a different state from a qualified breeder. She is passionate about rescuing animals and spending time with her husband. </p>
    <p> The journalist side of Dr. Mackay never dies. In her free time she also enjoys tweeting about current journalistic issues, and watching movies based on journalistic ethics. She also has numerous Pinterest boards to inform her followers of movies about journalists, vintage newspapers and handy tools for journalists as well. </p>
    <h2> My Opinion </h2>
      <p> I have a hard time understanding ethics with the way Dr. Mackay teaches the class, but she is very passionate about teaching ethics, especially when it comes to journalism. Her slides are very vague and she does not offer a lot more information on the topics in class, which makes studying for the exams difficult. </p>
      <p> The class grade was made up of two exams and then a group debate project. The debate topic for my group is explaining why a journalist should publish a story on classified information that they got ahold of. It will be difficult to win the debate considering the rebuttal side will argue us on national security issues. We are using Kant's Categorical Imperative and act utilitarianism to make our point that it is best for the greater good of people. </p>
      <p> This is my lowest grade this semester, but that is my own fault. I had a hard time studying for her exams and applying my understanding of the theories. </p>
