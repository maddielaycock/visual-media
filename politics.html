    <h2> Professional Biography </h2>
<p> Dr. Kuypers joined the Virginia Tech team in 2005 after working as a Distinguished Senior Lecturer and Director of the Office of Speech at Dartmouth College. Dr. Kuypers' area of expertise is political communication, strategic communication, rhetorical criticism, media bias and rhetorical framing analysis. Below are some of the classes Dr. Kuypers has taught here at Virginia Tech. </p>

  <p> Along with his teaching career, Dr. Kuypers is actively involved in the Rhetoric Society of Europe, as well as Southern State Communication Assciation. He has many books, articles, and book chapters published. As well as reviews and critical commentaries, introductions, prefaces, forwords, and paper presentations. He is well versed in all communication areas but has spent a lot of his time researching and teaching communication and politics. </p>

  <h2> Research </h2>
  <p> His research efforts are devoted primarily to exploring and understanding how professional politicians and citizens publicly address pressing social and cultural issues as these issues are relayed through the mediating lenses of the press. Kuypers is also a pioneer in the area of rhetorical framing analysis. This work has led to important discoveries concerning how original messages of political actors—professionals and citizens alike—are re-framed by the press before being transmitted to the general public. In particular, Kuypers’s methodology allows researchers to investigate how the news media act to shape public awareness, understanding, and evaluations of issues and events in a particular direction. </p>

    <h2> Interests </h2>
    <p> Even though Dr. Kuypers has spent much of his career in education and research, im sure he does some things in his free time other than politics. He has a young niece who he enjoys spending time with when she is in town. He also has two german sheppard dogs that he enjoys playing with and spending time outdoors with. </p>

    <h2> My Opinion </h2>
<p> Media and Politics is one of the more difficult classes I have taken here at Virginia Tech. Politics has never been one of my strong suits and I sometimes find it hard to keep up, especially with other students who worked on Capitol Hill and at CNN this past summer. A lot of my peers really like politics and know what they are talking about, while my Canadian self get confused. I have enjoyed this class and learning about the different ways media plays a role in elections and candidates, and it has challenged me. </p>
<p> The way that Dr. Kuypers teaches his class is a very college level way. He will put basic one word slides up and just talk on the subject for the whole class. It is hard to follow unless you write down literally every word he says in class, or else you will forget and it will be hard to study. There is only two exams and a final project for the overall grade so it is important to really pay attention and do well. He also offers an extra credit opportunity, which is a short paper and totally optional. You can tell he is very passionate about what he is teaching and is truly interested in communication and how it plays a role in all of politics. I have learned a lot from this class and it has sparked my interest in learning more about politics, but I wish sometimes it was a less intimidating class. </p>
